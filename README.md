# EldenRing-Mouse-Sensitivity-Patcher
Increase your mouse movement speed beyond allowed values


## How to use
- Select "Change Directory" and set it to the path of your game save directory.
- This is usually something like C:\Users\{YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\EldenRing\76543210987654321
- Click "Patch" and launch the game!

### Note:
When you're in-game and you go to system settings, if you visit the tab that shows your mouse sensitivity option, it will reset the changes. Just make sure to avoid that menu while your playing, otherwise you will have to re-patch it.
